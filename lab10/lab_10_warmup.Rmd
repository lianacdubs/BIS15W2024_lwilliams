Simulated malaria data #Load the data 
```{r}
malaria <- read_csv("data/malaria.csv") %>% clean_names()
```

```{r}
names(malaria)
```

```{r}
head(malaria) #age range is specified for those cases because column names contain information. 
```

#rdt refers to rapid diagnostic test 
##Data tidy
Pivot longer
```{r}
malaria_long <- malaria %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=starts_with("malaria_rdt"),
               names_to = "age_class",
               values_to = "cases") %>% 
  select(newid, data_date, submitted_date, location_name, province, district, age_class, cases)
```
^There is still work to make these cleaner like age_class is ugly. 

Which district had the highest number of cases on July 30, 2020?
```{r}
malaria_long %>% 
  filter(data_date=="2020-07-30") %>% 
  group_by(district) %>% 
  summarize(tot_cases=sum(cases, na.rm=T)) %>% 
  arrange(-tot_cases) #this is another way to do descending order. 
```
