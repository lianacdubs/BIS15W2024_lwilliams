```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#1. Load tidyverse and palmerspenguins libraries
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
library("palmerpenguins")
```

#2. What are the dimensions of the dataset penguins 
```{r}
dim(penguins)
```
#3.What is the names of the variables in the penguins dataset
```{r}
names(penguins)
```
Variables are columns 

#4. How many individuals were sampled on each island in the `penguins` dataset?
```{r}
penguins <- penguins #Look at the data spreadsheet
```

```{r}
table(penguins$island) #variable of interest is island
```

An alternative way to get it is...
```{r}
summary(penguins$island)
```

#5. What is the mean body mass for all individuals in the `penguins` dataset?

```{r}
mean(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm=T) 
#before adding na.rm=T the output is NA so, you have to do this command to get mean. 
```
